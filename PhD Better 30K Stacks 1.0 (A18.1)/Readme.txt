PhD Better 30K Stacks

Okay, I know what you're thinking, "What do we need another StackNumber mod for?" 

Well, first ask yourself this, "How many crazy ass hoarders do you know that are as bad as me?" 

Then think "Whose StackNumber mod would you like to try?" 

Yeah, I thought so.

Most StackNumber mods only change values in the items.xml file and that's fine for most hoarders. But if you happen to farm you'll find yourself having issues. This mod also updates the blocks.xml file so you can farm to your heart's content. 

You'll also find I change a few more values than most in the items.xml file as well. Whenever I found myself maxing out on an item I'd change its stack size. Over time this mod is what I came up with. So if you're a major hoarder than I think you'll find this mod to your liking. Give it a try and see what you think.
